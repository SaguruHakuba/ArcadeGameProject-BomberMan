the bomb can explode and have all the reactions with bricks, monsters, bomb and heros.              Works
the hero can be killed by monsters.                                                                 Works
the game can be paused by "p".                                                                      Works
the power-up can show up now but all power-up cannot be used currently.                             Works
each hero can have 2 bombs at the beginning but we may change it to 1 after.                        Works
we have a kind of monster now called goomba.                                                        Works



We will have power-up work next time.

By the way, we had our "u" and "d" occupied by other usages, so we used "-" and "=" to change the levels. Hope we can get the lost points back.





we like our work VERY MUCH and we will work hard for cycle 3.
